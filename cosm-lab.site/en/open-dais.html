                                    Time is a strategic aspect when we model context-aware systems. Despite natural and consensual perception of time, 
                                    the integrated modeling of its dimensions for the development of context-aware software is a recent research topic.

                                    The development of complicated software is always associated with many difficulties, problems, and errors. The quality verification
                                    process allows us to recognize many of these issues on their occurrence. The organization of automated and holistic verification is
                                    an important task for any software development. Especially, it is critical to a pet research project, which involves young specialists
                                    who are still learning the art of development.

                                    This report is focusing on verification problems and approaches used in the ongoing NITTA project. This project is dedicated to the
                                    development of CAD for hard-real time application-specific processors, which used a wide specter of technologies: Verilog (digital
                                    circuitry), Haskell (CAD itself), TypeSctipt (rich web application as UI), and in future Rust (control system) and Python (ML-based
                                    synthesis method). That raises the main question of the report: continuous integrity checking across different technologies and

                                    5G technology is the future of wireless communication, also known as cognitive radio network (CRN). 
                                    The CRN is helpful to mitigate the bandwidth crises problem that is one of the major issues in the current 
                                    wireless networks (3G, 4G). Cognitive radio performs four basic functions, such as spectrum sensing, 
                                    spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility. For spectrum sensing, vacant bands of 
                                    licensed users (LUs) are sensed by CR users.
                                    Now, we are presenting the fastest SS technique using two detectors i.e. ED_SAT (having a single threshold value) 
                                    and ED_TAT (having two threshold values) perform sensing operations simultaneously. The final decision is taken 
                                    by decision device (DD), simulation results prove that the proposed model has better detection at low SNRs and 
                                    at the cost of less sensing time.
